GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance, professional-grade animations.

### Core Concepts:
- **Tweens:** A tween is the fundamental building block of an animation. It's a single movement, fade, rotation, or any other change of a property over time.
- **Timelines:** A timeline is a sequence of tweens. It allows you to choreograph complex animations and control them as a whole (e.g., play, pause, reverse, speed up).
- **Selectors:** You can target elements using standard CSS selectors (e.g., `".my-class"`, `"#my-id"`).
- **Properties:** You animate CSS properties (e.g., `x`, `y`, `opacity`, `scale`, `rotation`).

### Basic Tween Syntax:
`gsap.to(".selector", { property: value, duration: 1, ... });`
- `gsap.to()`: Animates *to* the specified values.
- `gsap.from()`: Animates *from* the specified values.
- `gsap.fromTo()`: Animates *from* one set of values *to* another.

### Example: Simple Animation
```javascript
// Moves the element with the class 'box' 100px to the right over 1 second.
gsap.to(".box", { x: 100, duration: 1 });

// Fades in an element with the id 'header'
gsap.from("#header", { opacity: 0, duration: 1.5 });
```

### Timelines for Sequencing Animations:
Use a timeline to make animations happen in a sequence or overlap them.
```javascript
let tl = gsap.timeline();

// Chain animations together:
tl.to(".box1", { x: 200, duration: 1 })
  .to(".box2", { y: 100, scale: 1.2, duration: 1 }, "-=0.5") // Overlap by 0.5s
  .to(".box3", { rotation: 360, duration: 2 });
```

### Scroll-Triggered Animations (ScrollTrigger Plugin):
GSAP's ScrollTrigger plugin is the key to creating animations that react to the user scrolling down the page.
- You must register the plugin first: `gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);`

```javascript
gsap.to(".my-element", {
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: ".my-element", // The element that triggers the animation
    start: "top center",    // When the top of the trigger hits the center of the viewport
    end: "bottom center",   // When the bottom of the trigger hits the center of the viewport
    scrub: true,            // Smoothly scrubs the animation as the user scrolls
    markers: true,          // Shows visual markers for debugging (remove for production)
  },
  x: 500,
  rotation: 360,
  duration: 3,
});
```

### Best Practices for Beginners:
1.  **Start Simple:** Begin with single `gsap.to()` tweens before moving to timelines.
2.  **Use Selectors Wisely:** Give your animated elements clear classes or IDs.
3.  **Register Plugins:** If you use plugins like ScrollTrigger, you must register them at the start of your script.
4.  **Check the Docs:** GSAP's documentation is excellent and has many interactive examples. When in doubt, check the official docs.
5.  **Performance:** GSAP is very fast, but avoid animating too many complex properties on too many elements at once. Animate `x` and `y` instead of `left` and `top` for better performance.
