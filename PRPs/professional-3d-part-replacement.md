### Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Example structure for professional part implementation
class ProfessionalPart {
  constructor(scene) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.part = null;
    this.materials = {};
    this.animations = [];
  }

  async load() {
    // Load geometry
    const geometry = this.createPrecisionBearing(); // or load GLTF
    
    // Create materials
    this.materials.steel = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
      color: 0xE8E8E8,
      metalness: 0.95,
      roughness: 0.1,
      envMapIntensity: 1.0
    });
    
    // Apply materials
    this.part = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, this.materials.steel);
    
    // Add to scene
    this.scene.add(this.part);
  }
  
  createPrecisionBearing() {
    // Procedural generation of bearing geometry
    const group = new THREE.Group();
    
    // Outer race
    const outerRace = new THREE.TorusGeometry(2, 0.5, 8, 32);
    
    // Inner race
    const innerRace = new THREE.TorusGeometry(1.2, 0.3, 8, 32);
    
    // Ball bearings
    const ballGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.2, 16, 16);
    const ballCount = 12;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < ballCount; i++) {
      const angle = (i / ballCount) * Math.PI * 2;
      const ball = new THREE.Mesh(ballGeometry);
      ball.position.set(
        Math.cos(angle) * 1.6,
        0,
        Math.sin(angle) * 1.6
