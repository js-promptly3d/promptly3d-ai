# PRP: Interactive Text Buttons with Flip Animations

## Overview
Transform the static text elements "Input Analysis", "Constraint Application", "Optimization", and "Final Model" into interactive, clickable buttons that flip to reveal descriptive text when clicked, then flip back on subsequent clicks.

## Requirements

### 1. Convert Text to Clickable Buttons
- Transform the existing text elements into interactive button components
- Maintain semantic HTML structure with proper button elements or clickable divs
- Ensure keyboard accessibility (tab navigation, enter/space activation)
- Add hover states and cursor pointer to indicate interactivity

### 2. Add Flip Animations
- Implement smooth 3D flip animations using CSS transforms
- Use `transform: rotateY()` for horizontal flip effect
- Add `transform-style: preserve-3d` for proper 3D rendering
- Include `backface-visibility: hidden` to prevent text bleeding
- Set appropriate transition timing (suggested: 0.6s ease-in-out)
- Consider using CSS animations or JavaScript-controlled transforms

### 3. Create Descriptive Text Content

#### Input Analysis
**Front**: "Input Analysis"
**Back**: "AI analyzes your natural language description, extracting key design requirements, dimensions, and functional specifications to understand your vision."

#### Constraint Application
**Front**: "Constraint Application"
**Back**: "Manufacturing constraints and material properties are automatically applied to ensure your design is production-ready and cost-effective."

#### Optimization
**Front**: "Optimization"
**Back**: "Advanced algorithms optimize the design for strength, weight, and manufacturability while maintaining your aesthetic requirements."

#### Final Model
**Front**: "Final Model"
**Back**: "Your ready-to-manufacture 3D model is generated with proper tolerances, supports, and file formats for immediate production."

### 4. Implement Toggle Functionality
- Track state for each button (front/back facing)
- Toggle between states on click
- Ensure only one card can be flipped at a time (optional: allow multiple)
- Add smooth state transitions
- Preserve state during page interactions

### 5. Style to Match Website Design
- Maintain existing color scheme (purple gradient theme)
- Use consistent typography (Montserrat font family)
- Apply glassmorphism effect to match site aesthetic:
  ```css
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  ```
- Ensure responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Match existing button hover effects and transitions
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment with current layout

## Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure
```html
<div class="flip-card">
  <div class="flip-card-inner">
    <div class="flip-card-front">
      <h3>Input Analysis</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="flip-card-back">
      <p>Description text...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### CSS Animation
```css
.flip-card {
  perspective: 1000px;
}

.flip-card-inner {
  transition: transform 0.6s;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}

.flip-card.flipped .flip-card-inner {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
}
```

### JavaScript Functionality
```javascript
// Toggle flip state on click
card.addEventListener('click', () => {
  card.classList.toggle('flipped');
});
```

## Accessibility Requirements
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators
- Announce state changes to assistive technology
- Ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG standards

## Performance Considerations
- Use CSS transforms for GPU acceleration
- Minimize repaints and reflows
- Lazy load animations if needed
- Test on low-end devices for smooth performance

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Buttons are clickable and respond to user interaction
- [ ] Flip animations are smooth and consistent
- [ ] Text content is readable and properly formatted
- [ ] Toggle functionality works correctly
- [ ] Styling matches the existing website design
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior is correct
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works properly
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance is acceptable on all target devices

## Success Criteria
- All four text elements converted to interactive flip cards
- Smooth, professional animations that enhance user experience
- Clear, informative descriptions that explain each stage
- Consistent design that integrates seamlessly with existing site
- Accessible to all users regardless of ability or device
