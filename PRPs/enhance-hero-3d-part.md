# PRP: Enhance Hero Section 3D Part

## Goal
Replace the current 3D bearing in the hero section with a high-quality, complex manufacturing part that better demonstrates Promptly3D's capabilities.

## Business Justification
A sophisticated manufacturing component will better showcase the platform's ability to generate complex, production-ready parts and create a more impressive first impression.

## Technical Requirements
1. Design a complex multi-component assembly
2. Implement professional materials and finishes
3. Add interactive features and animations
4. Optimize for performance

## Part Design: Precision Gearbox Assembly
- Main housing with cooling fins
- Helical gear set (driver and driven)
- Ball bearings at key points
- Input/output shafts
- Oil seal assemblies
- Mounting brackets with M8 holes

## Implementation Steps
1. Create `PrecisionGearbox` class replacing bearing
2. Implement multi-component geometry
3. Add professional materials (anodized aluminum, steel gears)
4. Create smooth assembly/disassembly animation
5. Add hover interactions showing component details

## Success Metrics
- Visually impressive complex part
- Smooth 60 FPS performance
- Professional appearance
- Interactive component exploration
