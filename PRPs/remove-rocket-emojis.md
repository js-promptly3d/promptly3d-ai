# PRP: Remove Rocket Ship Emojis

## Goal
Remove all rocket ship emojis (ðŸš€) from the website and replace with more appropriate icons or remove entirely.

## Business Justification
Rocket emojis can appear unprofessional and clichÃ©. Removing them creates a more sophisticated, enterprise-ready appearance.

## Areas to Check
1. Pre-launch banner
2. Coming soon badges
3. Modal dialogs
4. Footer sections
5. Any status messages

## Replacement Strategy
- Pre-launch banner: Remove emoji entirely
- Coming soon badge: Use "â†’" or remove
- Modal dialogs: Use professional icons or none
- Launch messaging: Clean text only

## Implementation Steps
1. Search for ðŸš€ emoji in HTML
2. Search for rocket in CSS content
3. Remove or replace each instance
4. Verify visual consistency after removal
5. Test all interactive elements

## Success Metrics
- Zero rocket emojis remaining
- Professional appearance maintained
- No visual gaps from removal
- Consistent iconography throughout
