# Technical Content Enhancement: Manifold Resolution Principle Integration

> Replace generic AI descriptions with sophisticated manifold resolution and CSG workflow technical content

## Goal
Enhance website content to accurately reflect Promptly3D's advanced Manifold Resolution Principle, multi-agent CSG workflow, and AI-First Quality Framework, positioning it as a theoretically rigorous, production-ready AI CAD platform.

## Why
- Current content lacks technical depth that reflects the platform's sophisticated architecture
- Need to communicate theoretical foundation (Manifold Resolution Principle)
- Must emphasize production-ready quality assurance and manufacturing integration
- Should target engineering professionals with credible technical terminology

## Implementation Tasks
