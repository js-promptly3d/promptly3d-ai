# PRP: Hero Form Section Repositioning

## Overview
Reposition the hero form section to achieve better visual alignment with the left-side content and raise its vertical position for improved visual balance on the landing page.

## Current State
The hero form section is currently positioned independently from the left content, potentially creating visual imbalance or misalignment issues.

## Objectives
1. Align the form section horizontally with the left-side hero content
2. Raise the form's vertical position for better visual hierarchy
3. Maintain full responsive behavior across all device sizes
4. Preserve all existing form functionality and interactions

## Requirements

### Visual Alignment
- [ ] Analyze current positioning of left-side hero content
- [ ] Calculate optimal horizontal alignment between form and text content
- [ ] Ensure consistent spacing and margins
- [ ] Maintain visual hierarchy between headline, description, and form

### Vertical Positioning
- [ ] Raise form section to create better visual balance
- [ ] Consider fold visibility on common screen sizes
- [ ] Ensure form doesn't overlap with navigation or other elements
- [ ] Test scroll behavior and initial viewport presentation

### Responsive Design
- [ ] Maintain mobile-first responsive approach
- [ ] Test alignment on key breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 320px - 768px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1024px
  - Desktop: 1024px+
- [ ] Ensure form stacks appropriately on smaller screens
- [ ] Preserve touch-friendly spacing on mobile devices

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] Update CSS positioning properties
- [ ] Adjust container alignment and spacing
- [ ] Modify grid/flexbox properties as needed
- [ ] Test with existing GSAP animations
- [ ] Verify no conflicts with Three.js canvas positioning

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Analysis Phase
- [ ] Document current form positioning values
- [ ] Measure current alignment gaps
- [ ] Identify responsive breakpoint behaviors
- [ ] Review existing CSS structure

### 2. Design Phase
- [ ] Create alignment specifications
- [ ] Define new vertical position values
- [ ] Plan responsive adjustments
- [ ] Consider animation entry points

### 3. Implementation Phase
- [ ] Update hero form container positioning
- [ ] Adjust horizontal alignment CSS
- [ ] Modify vertical positioning values
- [ ] Update responsive media queries
- [ ] Test form submission functionality

### 4. Testing Phase
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Device testing (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Form functionality verification
- [ ] Animation compatibility check
- [ ] Performance impact assessment

## Success Criteria
- Form aligns visually with left-side content margin
- Improved vertical position creates better visual balance
- All responsive breakpoints maintain proper layout
- Form functionality remains unchanged
- No performance degradation
- Smooth animation transitions preserved

## Technical Considerations
- Preserve existing form validation
- Maintain Formspree integration
- Keep accessibility features intact
- Ensure z-index layering is correct
- Test with WebGL canvas backdrop

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Desktop alignment at 1920x1080
- [ ] Desktop alignment at 1366x768
- [ ] Tablet landscape (1024x768)
- [ ] Tablet portrait (768x1024)
- [ ] Mobile devices (375x667, 414x896)
- [ ] Form submission test
- [ ] Animation performance
- [ ] Page load performance

## Rollback Plan
- Keep backup of current CSS positioning
- Document all changed values
- Test in staging before production
- Monitor user engagement metrics post-deployment

## Notes
- Consider A/B testing the new position if significant change
- Monitor form conversion rates after repositioning
- Gather user feedback on visual improvements
- Document any edge cases discovered during implementation
