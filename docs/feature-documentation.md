## 3D Model Manipulation Tool

**Purpose:**
Allow users to interact with and manipulate 3D models directly in the browser, similar to [zoo.dev/text-to-cad](https://zoo.dev/text-to-cad).

**Usage:**
- Users can rotate, pan, and zoom the 3D model using mouse or touch controls.
- Users can select and manipulate parts of the model (move, scale, rotate).
- The tool provides visual feedback (highlighting, snapping, undo/redo).

**Technical Details:**
- Built with Three.js for rendering and interaction.
- Uses raycasting for object selection and manipulation.
- Implements orbit controls for camera navigation.
- Supports drag-and-drop for model import/export (GLB, OBJ, STL).
- Optimized for performance with LOD and efficient picking.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

**Code Snippet:**
```js
// Example: Setting up Three.js scene with orbit controls
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(...);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer(...);
const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);
// ...
```

## Interactive Animations

**Purpose:**
Enhance user experience with smooth, engaging animations for UI elements and 3D objects.

**Usage:**
- Entrance/exit animations for components.
- Hover and active state transitions.
- Animated camera moves and object transformations in 3D scenes.

**Technical Details:**
- Uses GSAP for timeline-based UI and 3D animations.
- Integrates with Three.js AnimationMixer for model animations.
- Respects user preferences for reduced motion.

**Code Snippet:**
```js
// Example: GSAP animation for a UI element
import { gsap } from 'gsap';
gsap.from('.hero-title', { opacity: 0, y: 50, duration: 1 });
```
