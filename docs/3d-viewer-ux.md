# 3D Viewer UX Best Practices

This document outlines the user experience (UX) best practices for the interactive 3D model viewer on the Promptly3D website. The goal is to make the viewer intuitive, engaging, and easy to use.

## 1. Camera Controls

- **Rule:** The camera must be easy to control with a mouse or touch.
- **Guideline:** Implement orbit controls (left-click and drag), pan controls (right-click and drag), and zoom controls (scroll wheel or pinch).
- **Guideline:** The camera should have limits to prevent the user from getting lost or clipping through the model.
- **Guideline:** Provide a button to reset the camera to its initial position.

## 2. Loading and Feedback

- **Rule:** A clear loading indicator must be displayed while the 3D model is loading.
- **Guideline:** The loading indicator should show the loading progress if possible.
- **Guideline:** Once loaded, the model should fade in smoothly.

## 3. Interaction

- **Guideline:** Provide clear visual feedback when the user hovers over or clicks on the 3D model or its parts.
- **Guideline:** If parts of the model are selectable, they should be clearly highlighted.
- **Guideline:** Consider adding annotations or tooltips to provide more information about the model.

## 4. Performance

- **Rule:** The 3D viewer must be performant and maintain a high frame rate.
- **Guideline:** Optimize the 3D model by reducing the polygon count and using efficient materials.
- **Guideline:** Use Three.js best practices to ensure the scene is rendered efficiently.
