# Promptly3D - AI-Powered 3D Design Platform

![Promptly3D Logo](promptly3d-logo.png)

Promptly3D is a forward-thinking web platform designed to revolutionize 3D modeling. It allows users to transform their ideas into manufacturable 3D designs using natural language, removing the need for specialized CAD skills. This repository contains the source code for the project's landing page and user interaction interface.

**Live Demo:** [**promptly3d.ai**](https://promptly3d.ai/)

## Project Vision & Inspiration
Promptly3D is inspired by the next generation of creative tools, such as [zoo.dev/text-to-cad](https://zoo.dev/text-to-cad), and aims to make 3D design accessible, interactive, and fun for everyone. Our philosophy is rooted in "vibe coding": rapid prototyping, creative exploration, and pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible with web-based 3D and animation.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language to 3D Model:** Users can describe their desired object using plain English (text, voice, or even sketches). The AI interprets these descriptions to generate precise 3D geometry.
- **Conversational Refinement:** The design can be iteratively improved through a natural conversation with the AI. Make adjustments like "add a 5mm fillet to all edges" or "make it 20% stronger."
- **Manufacturing-Ready Exports:** Instantly generate files ready for production, including STEP for machining, optimized STL for 3D printing, and professional technical drawings.
- **Manufacturer Marketplace:** Connect directly with a network of verified manufacturers to get quotes and order parts without leaving the platform.
- **Dynamic & Interactive UI:** The website is built with a modern, responsive interface featuring smooth animations (powered by GSAP) and interactive elements to guide the user.
- **Advanced Form Handling:** A single, intelligent contact form dynamically adjusts fields and submission endpoints for different user types (Users, Vendors, Developers, Investors).
- **Interactive 3D Preview (Planned):** While [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) is included in the project, the interactive 3D model viewer is a planned feature that is not yet implemented in `script.js`.

## Getting Started
This is a static website with no complex build process. To run it locally, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/promptly3d.ai.git
cd promptly3d.ai
```

**2. Open in your browser:**
You can simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
```
open index.html
```
For the best development experience, including hot-reloading, we recommend using a live server. If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.

---

## Configuration
### Formspree Integration
The contact form relies on **Formspree** to handle submissions. You will need to create your own Formspree forms and update the endpoints in `script.js`.

The project is configured to use different endpoints for each user type selected in the form's dropdown menu.

**File to edit:** `script.js`

Update the `formEndpoints` object with your own Formspree URLs:
```javascript
// script.js
class Promptly3DApp {
    constructor() {
        this.formEndpoints = {
            users: 'https://formspree.io/f/{your_users_form_id}',
            vendors: 'https://formspree.io/f/{your_vendors_form_id}',
            developers: 'https://formspree.io/f/{your_developers_form_id}',
            investors: 'https://formspree.io/f/{your_investors_form_id}'
        };
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Project Structure
The codebase is organized into three main files:
- `index.html`: Contains the main HTML structure and all page content.
- `style.css`: Provides the styling, branding, layout, and responsive design for the entire site.
- `script.js`: Handles all interactivity, including animations, form validation, and dynamic content.

---

## How to Use the Rules System
- **.cursorrules:** The master rules file for project-wide standards, philosophy, and workflow. Start here for high-level guidance.
- **.cursor/rules/:** Modular, topic-specific rules (e.g., 3D UX, animation, security, design system, prompt engineering). Reference these for detailed best practices.
- **docs/:** Human-readable documentation, feature guides, onboarding, and creative resources.
- **Prompt Library:** Use and contribute to the prompt library for AI-powered coding, creative inspiration, and ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù sessions.

---

## Deployment
This is a static website and can be deployed to any static hosting provider.

Based on our current plan, the website will be hosted using **Cloudflare Pages**, which provides excellent performance, security, and continuous deployment features.

## Important Notes

### Current Reality vs. Documentation
This project has extensive documentation for advanced 3D features in `.cursor/rules/` and `docs/`, but the **current implementation is a static website**. The documentation serves as:
- **Future Vision:** Roadmap for where the project is heading
- **Standards:** Code quality and architecture principles
- **Preparation:** Guidelines for when 3D features are implemented

### Three.js Integration Status
- ‚úÖ **Three.js is loaded** in `index.html` (r128 from CDN)
- ‚ùå **No 3D scene exists** in `script.js`
- ‚ùå **No WebGL initialization** or 3D rendering
- üéØ **Ready for integration** when Phase 2 begins

### Getting Started as a Contributor
1. **Understand the current state:** Professional static website with forms and animations
2. **Review existing code:** See `script.js` for current JavaScript patterns
3. **Check the roadmap:** Know what features are planned vs. implemented
4. **Start small:** Improve existing features before adding new ones
